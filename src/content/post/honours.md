## Abstract
Facial expressions are a fundamental part of human communication used to convey non- verbal cues during interaction with other people. Humans are adept at reading these cues, although they are difficult to capture with traditional camera-based methods. Analysis of these expressions is an increasingly important field with applications in psychology, animation, medicine, and security.
Recent advancements in the field of image registration have opened up opportunities for improvement in the modelling of facial expressions. A two-camera stereoscope was designed and constructed. The stereoscope is capable of capturing time-synchronous photographs of a subject transitioning from a neutral face to an expression. Stereo reconstruction was then used to estimate the 3D geometry of the neutral face, and individual pixels were tracked throughout the expression to produce point clouds with point-to-point correspondence.
This process was able to be applied to a simplified case of tracking rigid body motion on a highly textured rock, however, difficulties arose when applying tracking to facial expressions. It is suspected this is due to a lack of texture captured with the current setup. A principle component analysis pipeline was also developed which has the potential to extract dominant modes of deformations from expressions once accurate models are produced with point-to-point correspondence.
